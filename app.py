        - Title: {lead_title}
        - Email: {lead_email}
        - Location: {lead_location}
        - Industry: {lead_industry}
        - Skills: {lead_skills if lead_skills else 'None'}
        - Other Info: {lead_other_info if lead_other_info else 'None'}
        - Keywords: {lead_keywords if lead_keywords else 'None'}

        **Company Information:**
        - Company Name: {company_name}
        - Industry: {company_industry}
        - Company Size: {company_size}

        - Recent Events: {company_recent_events if company_recent_events else 'None'}
        - Keywords: {company_keywords if company_keywords else 'None'}


        **Recent Content:**
        - Lead's Most Recent Post: {lead_recent_post if lead_recent_post else 'None'}
        - Company’s Most Recent Post: {company_recent_post if company_recent_post else 'None'}

        **Recent Projects:**
        - Most Recent Project: {recent_project if recent_project else 'None'}

        **Sender (Email Author):**
        - Name: {sender.get('name', 'N/A')}
        - Title: {sender.get('title', 'N/A')}
        - Company: {sender.get('company', 'N/A')}

        - Industry: {sender_company.get('industry', 'N/A')}
        - Website: {sender_company.get('website_url', 'N/A')}

        ### Selection Logic:

        1. **Identify 1-2 key topics**:
            - Focus on **shared interests or mutual benefits** such as a specific achievement, recent project, or post that resonates with both the lead and the sender.
            - Avoid covering too many topics. Select the **most relevant data points** from the provided input.

        2. **Prioritize depth over breadth**:
            - Instead of touching on multiple points, expand on the chosen topics with personalized insights or meaningful context.

        3. Create **relevance**:
            - Use data like lead's or company's recent post, achievements, or projects to establish context for collaboration.
            - Ensure there’s a logical flow in how the topics are connected to the sender’s goals.

        4. End with a **specific, open-ended call to action** to initiate a meaningful conversation.


        ### Objective:
        - Craft a tailored email that captures the recipient's attention by focusing on one or two compelling topics.
        - Highlight how the sender's expertise or offerings align with the recipient’s work.
        - Maintain a warm, professional tone.
        - Please generate the email content only, without any additional commentary or explanation.

        ### Example Email Flow:
        - **Opening**: Start by referencing a shared or relevant insight from the prioritized data.
        - **Body**: Highlight mutual benefits or unique contributions from either the sender or receiver. Avoid introducing unrelated topics.
        - **Conclusion**: Conclude with a relevant and specific call to action (e.g., suggesting a meeting to explore potential synergies).
